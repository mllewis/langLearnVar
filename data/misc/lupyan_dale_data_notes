Morphological Complexity:

paper reports 28 variables

(1) My variable ("morphological.complexity") - WALS dataset (from Lupyan and Dale)
- 27 variables (1 missing from dataset)
- different coding of levels to complexity 
- present for 1991 languages

(2) L&D variable ("adjusted.complexity") - aggregated complexity dataset
- 24 variables
- Only 863 langauges of 1477 have ISOs (identified by language names, not ISO)
- very not-normal
- positively correlated with acquistion
- changes loadings on PCA
- population significant in individual model

* weakly correlated (r = -.31)
