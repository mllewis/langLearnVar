Social scale and structural complexity in human languages

- relationship between life expectancy and age reproduction, both across species and across human societies

- more complext social groups -> more complex communication systems

- potential vs. actual in terms of complexity

- Reason social and lang as previously not been expored:
* no big datasets (until WALS)
* equality of people
* what's the mechanism? Languages don't show purposful behavior.


Ways in which language complexity varies:
- paradigmatic vs. syntagmatic complexity

- phonological inventory size and complexity bias (small inventory more bigger bias, because more concatenating going on)
- languages with bigger speaker population have bigger phonological inventiory (maybe this explains the complexity bias correlation?)
- word length ocrrelated with log population size

Note that the associations run in opposite directions: 

====> lots of speakers: lots of sounds, short words, morpologically simple, but word order informative (vs. few speakers [how does this compare to kids])
